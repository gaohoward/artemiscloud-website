      content: "The Artemis Container images are fully compatible with major could environments
      such as Kubernetes and Openshift. Built on Apache ActiveMQ Artemis project,
      They provide enterprise level messaging abilities for users
      to build as a part of their mission critical applications within clould architectures. As Cloud
      services they have all the benefits that are not available otherwise such as saving hardware
      and software maintenance cost, having a unified security infrastructure and high availabilities,
      accessible all around the world.
      The ActiveMQ Artemis Operator enables user to deploy, configure and manage Artemis broker in the cloud
      in easy and comprehensive ways. It further eliminates burdens of administrators and developers
      from dealing with resources, configurations, maintenance and others so that they can be more
      focus on their business logics. The ActiveMQ Artemis Operator and Artemis messaging broker
      not only can help new businesses to build their cloud applications from scratch, but also can make
      traditional businesses with long running non-cloud applications to migrate into cloud environments
      efficiently."

      content: "As part of a group of open-sourced projects collectively called ArtemisCloud,
      The ActiveMQ Artemis Operator works smoothly within Kubernetes environment and will continually
      keep up to date with Kubernetes as it progresses. That means users and companies can rely on
      ArtemisCloud to have latest features, enhancements, security updates and bug fixes that are
      much needed for their businesses in a timely manner. On the other hand the ArtemisCould community
      listens to and involves in the open-source world, getting feedbacks and expectations and improve
      its functionality. With ArtemisCloud in Kubernetes users can perform tasks such as

      * Deploy ActiveMQ Artemis container image that provide enterprise level, multi-protocol messaging services
      * Scaling up and down broker pods as needed
      * Configuring/managing broker
      * Dynamically create/delete destinations
      * Safely migrate persistent messages while scaling down broker pods
      * Rolling updates"

      content: "The ArtemisCloud also supports Red Hat's Openshift platform.
      With Openshift you get extra benefits like consistent security,
      built-in monitoring and centralized policy management. The Red Hat's AMQ
      broker operator and container images are based on ArtemisCould and ActiveMQ
      Artemis opensource projects. The operator image bundles are built into
      Openshift's Operator-Hub that makes things a lot easier. Many of the tasks
      that used to be done from command line are now available from Operator-Hub's
      web console. Updating of operators/images becomes ever more easier and safer."

    - name: "Protocol rich"
      icon: "ti-alarm-clock"
      content: "With ActiveMQ Artemis Kubernetes image deployed into your cloud
      you'll have a cloud messaging service with a rich set of procotols for you
      to choose. That protocols including AMQP, MQTT, STOMP, JMS, and CORE with
      security supports. This allows a wide range of applications to comunicate
      with messaging service without adding any extra efforts. Multiprotocol support
      make sure that businesses that are relying on fast and reliable messaging
      service all over the internet can grow at a global scale. Messaging service
      in a cloud based on ArtemisCloud can be accessed anywhere and anytime
      via any of the supported protocols."

    # feature item loop
    - name: "High Availability"
      icon: "ti-pulse"
      content: "With ActiveMQ Artemis Operator and Container images high availability
      becomes a native feature. Pods can be spawn up and brought down. Performance
      can be tuned based on specific use-cases through configuration optimization.
      For enterprise level messaging service that's not all. ArtemisCloud makes sure
      important business data will not get lost in case of pod failures. It takes care
      of this by watching all live broker pods. If any pod fails the operator can detect
      it in real time and can perform message migration -- any persistent messages that
      are left by the dead pod are moved to a healthy live pod and continue to be processed.
      That means your applications will not be interrupted in such cases."
